# CringeLang
Esoteric coding language. Cringey.

Built for my Advanced Programming Languages class, CringeLang is supported and interpreted through TextX, built in Python. The main functions for this language is playing meme sounds, dispaying memes, and sending automated WhatsApp texts to chosen recipients, with few other features.

To get an idea for the language and it's syntax rules, view the cringe.tx file. 
Sample program in cringe.crl, and the interpreter code ran through textX is in cringe.py.

Enjoy!
